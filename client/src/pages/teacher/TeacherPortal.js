          <p>
            Thank you for joining our mission to help educators succeed in their
            job interviews. Your role as a mentor and interviewer is invaluable,
            and we are excited to have you as part of our team. Here at Grow
            With Guru, you'll find features that allow you to prepare, ask
            questions, and respond to interviews. You can easily schedule and
            conduct mock interviews, review and provide feedback, and track your
            progress. Together, we can bridge the gap between knowledge,
            training, and real-world requirements, elevating educators with
            role-prepared to take their career aspirations to new heights.
